The light control skill can assist with the following tasks:
- Turning specific lights or plugs on or off. Example: "Switch on the living room light" or "Turn off the kitchen plug."
- Listing all available lights or plugs. Example: "List all lights" or "Show available plugs."

To control a device, say "switch" followed by "on" or "off" and the device name.
