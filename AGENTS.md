## 0. Project overview

**Golden rule**: When unsure about implementation details or requirements, ALWAYS consult the developer rather than making assumptions.

This is a **Home Automation Skill** for a **Modular Private Assistant** system that controls smart plugs and bulbs via **zigbee2mqtt** through MQTT messaging. It's part of a distributed microservice architecture where each skill runs independently in its own container.

**Architecture**: Distributed skills listen to MQTT intent analysis results and respond based on certainty scores. Communication flow: Voice → Text → Intent Analysis → MQTT broadcast → Skills respond. The skill communicates directly with zigbee2mqtt (not Home Assistant) and uses PostgreSQL to store device configurations.

## 1. Non-negotiable golden rules

| #: | AI *may* do                                                            | AI *must NOT* do                                                                    |
|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| G-0 | Whenever unsure about something that's related to the project, ask the developer for clarification before making changes.    |  ❌ Write changes or use tools when you are not sure about something project specific, or if you don't have context for a particular feature/decision. |
| G-1 | Generate code **only inside** relevant source directories (e.g., `src/`) or explicitly pointed files.    | ❌ Touch `tests/`, `SPEC.md`, or any `*_spec.py` / `*.ward` files (humans own tests & specs). |
| G-2 | Add/update **`AIDEV-NOTE:` anchor comments** near non-trivial edited code. | ❌ Delete or mangle existing `AIDEV-` comments.                                     |
| G-3 | Follow lint/style configs (`pyproject.toml`, `.ruff.toml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`). Use the project's configured linter, if available, instead of manually re-formatting code. | ❌ Re-format code to any other style.                                               |
| G-4 | For changes >300 LOC or >3 files, **ask for confirmation**.            | ❌ Refactor large modules without human guidance.                                     |
| G-5 | Stay within the current task context. Inform the dev if it'd be better to start afresh.                                  | ❌ Continue work from a prior prompt after "new task" – start a fresh session.      |

## Critical Architecture Decisions

### Core Components
- **SwitchSkill**: Main skill class extending `private_assistant_commons.BaseSkill`
- **SwitchSkillDevice**: SQLModel for device data (topic, alias, room, on/off payloads)
- **Device Cache**: In-memory cache for fast device lookups, loads on first access
- **MQTT Communication**: Fire-and-forget device control via zigbee2mqtt topics

### Key Design Patterns
- **Dependency Injection**: `SwitchSkillDependencies` container reduces constructor complexity
- **Template-based Responses**: Jinja2 templates for natural language generation
- **Room-aware Device Resolution**: Prioritizes current room, falls back to global search

### Database Schema
- No migration strategy (waiting for SQLModel roadmap)

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Package Manager**: UV (modern pip replacement)
- **Dependency Management**: pyproject.toml with dependency groups
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage
- **Linting**: Ruff (replaces flake8, isort, black)
- **Type Checking**: mypy
- **Git Hooks**: pre-commit

---

## Coding standards

- **Python**: 3.12+.
- **Formatting**: `ruff` enforces 120-char lines, double quotes, sorted imports. Standard `ruff` linter rules.
- **Typing**: Strict (Pydantic v2 models preferred); `from __future__ import annotations`.
- **Naming**: `snake_case` (functions/variables), `PascalCase` (classes), `SCREAMING_SNAKE` (constants).
- **Error Handling**: Typed exceptions; context managers for resources.
- **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings for public functions/classes.
- **Testing**: Separate test files matching source file patterns.

**Error handling patterns**:

- Use typed, hierarchical exceptions defined in `exceptions.py`
- Catch specific exceptions, not general `Exception`
- Use context managers for resources (database connections, file handles)
- For async code, use `try/finally` to ensure cleanup

- `pre-commit run --all-files`: Run all pre-commit hooks

---

## 5. Anchor comments

Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase, where appropriate, for yourself as inline knowledge that can be easily `grep`ped for.

### Guidelines

- Use `AIDEV-NOTE:`, `AIDEV-TODO:`, or `AIDEV-QUESTION:` (all-caps prefix) for comments aimed at AI and developers.
- Keep them concise (≤ 120 chars).
- **Important:** Before scanning files, always first try to **locate existing anchors** `AIDEV-*` in relevant subdirectories.
- **Update relevant anchors** when modifying associated code.
- **Do not remove `AIDEV-NOTE`s** without explicit human instruction.
- Make sure to add relevant anchor comments, whenever a file or piece of code is:
  - too long, or
  - too complex, or
  - very important, or
  - confusing, or
  - could have a bug unrelated to the task you are currently working on.

Example:

```python
# AIDEV-NOTE: perf-hot-path; avoid extra allocations (see ADR-24)
async def render_feed(...):
    ...
```

---

## 6. Commit discipline - ALL AI AGENTS MUST FOLLOW THIS

- **Granular commits**: One logical change per commit. The LEAST is ONE commit per issue. CLAUDE stick to this!
- **Tag AI-generated commits**: e.g., `feat: optimise feed query [AI]`.
- **Clear commit messages**: Explain the *why*; link to issues/ADRs if architectural. If an issue is fixed reference it as closes #XX. One reference per issue.
- **Use `git worktree`** for parallel/long-running AI branches (e.g., `git worktree add ../wip-foo -b wip-foo`).
- **Review AI-generated code**: Never merge code you don't understand.
- **Always use conventional commit standard with gitmoji**: e.g. "feat:" "perf: :zap:"

---

## 10. Directory-Specific AGENTS.md Files

- **Always check for `AGENTS.md` files in specific directories** before working on code within them. These files contain targeted context.
- If a directory's `AGENTS.md` is outdated or incorrect, **update it**.
- If you make significant changes to a directory's structure, patterns, or critical implementation details, **document these in its `AGENTS.md`**.
- If a directory lacks a `AGENTS.md` but contains complex logic or patterns worth documenting for AI/humans, **suggest creating one**.

---

## 12. Versioning conventions

Semantic Versioning (SemVer: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) is generally followed, as specified in each component's `pyproject.toml` file.

- **MAJOR** version update: For incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR** version update: For adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH** version update: For backward-compatible bug fixes.

---

## 15. Meta: Guidelines for updating AGENTS.md files

### Elements that would be helpful to add

1. **Decision flowchart**: A simple decision tree for "when to use X vs Y" for key architectural choices would guide my recommendations.
2. **Reference links**: Links to key files or implementation examples that demonstrate best practices.
3. **Domain-specific terminology**: A small glossary of project-specific terms would help me understand domain language correctly.
4. **Versioning conventions**: How the project handles versioning, both for APIs and internal components.

### Format preferences

1. **Consistent syntax highlighting**: Ensure all code blocks have proper language tags (`python`, `bash`, etc.).
2. **Hierarchical organization**: Consider using hierarchical numbering for subsections to make referencing easier.
3. **Tabular format for key facts**: The tables are very helpful - more structured data in tabular format would be valuable.
4. **Keywords or tags**: Adding semantic markers (like `#performance` or `#security`) to certain sections would help me quickly locate relevant guidance.

[^1]: This principle emphasizes human oversight for critical aspects like architecture, testing, and domain-specific decisions, ensuring AI assists rather than fully dictates development.

## 16. Files to NOT modify

These files control which files should be ignored by AI tools and indexing systems:

- @.agentignore : Specifies files that should be ignored by the Cursor IDE, including:
  - Build and distribution directories
  - Environment and configuration files
  - Large data files (parquet, arrow, pickle, etc.)
  - Generated documentation
  - Package-manager files (lock files)
  - Logs and cache directories
  - IDE and editor files
  - Compiled binaries and media files

- @.agentindexignore : Controls which files are excluded from Cursor's indexing to improve performance, including:
  - All files in `.agentignore`
  - Files that may contain sensitive information
  - Large JSON data files
  - Generated TypeSpec outputs
  - Memory-store migration files
  - Docker templates and configuration files

**Never modify these ignore files** without explicit permission, as they're carefully configured to optimize IDE performance while ensuring all relevant code is properly indexed.

**When adding new files or directories**, check these ignore patterns to ensure your files will be properly included in the IDE's indexing and AI assistance features.

## AI Assistant Workflow: Step-by-Step Methodology

When responding to user instructions, the AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, GPT, etc.) should follow this process to ensure clarity, correctness, and maintainability:

1. **Consult Relevant Guidance**: When the user gives an instruction, consult the relevant instructions from `AGENTS.md` files (both root and directory-specific) for the request.
2. **Clarify Ambiguities**: Based on what you could gather, see if there's any need for clarifications. If so, ask the user targeted questions before proceeding.
3. **Break Down & Plan**: Break down the task at hand and chalk out a rough plan for carrying it out, referencing project conventions and best practices.
4. **Trivial Tasks**: If the plan/request is trivial, go ahead and get started immediately.
5. **Non-Trivial Tasks**: Otherwise, present the plan to the user for review and iterate based on their feedback.
6. **Track Progress**: Use a to-do list (internally, or optionally in a `TODOS.md` file) to keep track of your progress on multi-step or complex tasks.
7. **If Stuck, Re-plan**: If you get stuck or blocked, return to step 3 to re-evaluate and adjust your plan.
8. **Update Documentation**: Once the user's request is fulfilled, update relevant anchor comments (`AIDEV-NOTE`, etc.) and `AGENTS.md` files in the files and directories you touched.
9. **User Review**: After completing the task, ask the user to review what you've done, and repeat the process as needed.
10. **Session Boundaries**: If the user's request isn't directly related to the current context and can be safely started in a fresh session, suggest starting from scratch to avoid context confusion.
